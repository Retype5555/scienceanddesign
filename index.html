					<div class="card description">
						<h4>üìë<br>By Project</h4>
						<p>Needs change from project to project. For example, you may need discovery research that could take a week or two, or not. Or, requirements might change after engineering teams plan their release, requiring significant design revisions.</p>
						<p>This is good for companies that need consistent help for a project with a beginning and an end.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card description">
						<h4>‚è±<br>Fixed Time Units</h4>
						<p>Choose from one day, week, month, or quarter. With fixed time units, there is no guarantee of a project's completion.</p>
						<p>This is good for companies or organizations needing temporary help or with a tighter budget.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="groupRow center">
					<div class="card description">
						<h4>üóì<br>Monthly Retainers</h4>
						<p class="badge">‚ù§Ô∏è Best Value</p>
						<p>A rolling engagement meant for long-term professional relationships. Choose from 5, 10, 15, or 20 hours per week.</p>
						<p>This is good for companies needing consistent help throughout the year on a variety of projects. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="card description">
						<h4>üîç<br>Critique</h4>
						<p>A 1-hour video chat where we'll review any project you're working on. You'll receive structured and actionable feedback on interface, interaction, visual design, messaging, branding, typography, and more.</p>
						<p>This is good for companies that want an outside perspective on your work or junior designers needing guidance.</p>
