						<h4>👁<br>Interface Design</h4>
						<p>What your customers see when using your software should be clear, relevant, and intuitive.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card description">
						<h4>🤳<br>Interaction Design</h4>
						<p>This is so important - if your software isn't easy to use, people will go somewhere else. It's that simple.</p>

					<div class="card description">
						<h4>🌎<br>Web Design</h4>

						<h4>📑<br>By Project</h4>
						<p>Needs change from project to project. You may need discovery research that could take a week or two, or not. Or, requirements might change after engineering teams plan their release, requiring significant design revisions.</p>
						<p>This is good for companies that need consistent help for a project with a beginning and an end.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="card description">
						<h4>⏱<br>Fixed Time Units</h4>
						<p>Choose from one day, one week, one month, or one quarter. With fixed time units, there is no guarentee of a project's completion.</p>
						<p>This is good for companies or organizations needing temporary help or on a tighter budget. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="groupRow center">
					<div class="card description">
						<h4>🗓<br>Monthly Retainers</h4>
						<p class="badge">❤️ Best Value</p>
						<p>A rolling engagement meant for long-term professional relationships. Choose from 5, 10, 15, or 20 hours per week.</p>
						<p>This is good for companies needing consistent help throughout the year on a variety of projects. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="card description">
						<h4>🔍<br>Critique</h4>
						<p>A 1-hour video chat where we'll review of any project that you're working on. You'll receive structured and actionable feedback on interface, interaction, and visual design, messaging, branding, typography, and more.</p>
						<p>This is good for companies that want an outside perspective on your work, or for junior designers needing guidance.</p>
