# Payment Model

Work obtained through **MAKER** will have a 10% fee applied to support administrative costs. At the end of the year, the remaining profits are distributed back to the members according to their annual activity.

In the example below, two members have collectively earned $300,000, and one has no activity. Member 1's business of $100,000 is 33% of the total revenue that year, and member 3's $200,000 makes 67% of the revenue. MAKER's 10% fee is $30,000.

A total of $5,500 applied for administrative costs leaves $24,500 in profit.

At the end of the year, member one will receive $8,167, or 33% of the profits, and member three will receive $16,333. The inactive member remains a member, with no funds distributed to them. 

Members have the options of being awarded with time credits for their work.
