## About

Some of the most important projects and organizations online are underresourced and understaffed. Science & Design's mission is to make organizations that create software in the public interest as successful as possible.

Science & Design is operated by [Glenn Sorrentino](https://glennsorrentino.com). Glenn is a product designer and user researcher that's spent over a decade designing systems and building products at scale for a leading Fortune 500. His work has led to US patents, invitations to collaborate with organizations and institutions like New America, Harvard, and the World Economic Forum, and has helped to set industry standards for interface and interaction design. Glenn deeply understands how successful product teams operate, how to work effectively with distributed teams, and is passionate about creating ethical software.

And we're bigger than just one person. We're a global network of designers, researchers, engineers, writers, and technologists focused on helping to make the world better. Let's work together.
